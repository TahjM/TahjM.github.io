    As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in
    <br> my arms and set out the walking once more. <span class="basic-underline"> I felt deeply  <br> moved, and stirred.
    It seemed to me that I was <br> carrying a very fragile treasure.</span> <span class="highlight"> It seemed to me, even,
    <br> that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. </span>In the <br> moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed
    <br> eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I <br> said to myself: <span class="color"> "What I see here is nothing but a
    <br> shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span> <br> As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a
    <br> half-smile. I said to myself, again: <span class="color"> "What moves me <br> so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping
    <br> here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of rose <br> that shines through the whole being like the flame
    <br> of a lamp, even when he is asleep. . ." </span> And I felt <br> him to be more fragile still. <span class="basic-underline">
    I felt the need of <br> protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that <br> might be estimated by a little puff of wind . . .</span>
